# Business-Analysis-on-Employee-Attrition

**About the Project**

This Project is all about a IBM churn where I have analyzed the key insights from the dataset that what were the factor that might be causing the attrition in the company.

**Process**
> Imported necessary libraries to my Jupyter notebook
> Loaded the data od shape (1029,35), that is it has 1029 rows along with 35 columns
> To understand the data in a better manner , I watched few rows from first or last
> To know stastical values of the columns , applied some functions like "describe()" and to check the datatypes, applied "info()"
> Now that we have gone through data and understood it on some extend
> Performed data cleaning , checked for null values, handling null values, removing duplicate values using appropriate functions
> Performed univariate analysis , Bivariate analysis , multivariate analysis to find the insights
> Used graphical representation to show the insights , since this is better way to understand data
